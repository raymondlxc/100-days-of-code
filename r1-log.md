# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Raymond]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [Sept 11, Tuesday, 2018].

## Log

### R1D1 
Solved Two Database problems in the Leetcode; Sovled two algorithm problem of the book <<Introduction to Classical ACM Problems>>

### R1D2
Solved all the problems in the Second Chapter of the book<<Introduction to Classical ACM Problems>>.
  
### R1D3
I've completed the interview problems of  Chapter One of the Pinceton Algorithm and a leetcode. Today is the R1D3. I know I am a little behind but I will try to catch up. I was busy with the application for the dean's scholarship last week.>>.

### R1D4
Today is R1D4, I've completed one leetcode and the fourth chapter of a guidebook of Java. And I am also working on the coding homework of the Princeton Algorithm. >>

### R1D5
Today is R1D5, I've completed the Percolation problem of the Princeton Algorithm. It feels soooo good to see the program produces the desire outcome, though the debugging process is quite tedious.

### R1D6
Forgot to tweet for the last few days. I got a bad cold recently... I completed the courses of the second week of the  Algorithm (Part One) provided by Princeton on Coursera. Today is R1D6. I should be more self disciplined. 

### R1D7 
I completed two algorithm problems on the LeetCode, one is easy and the other one is medium. And I also completed all the videos of the second chapter of the Algorithm(Part One) by the Princeton.

### R1D8
Completed one medium problem on LeetCode, which is about linked list. At first it couldn't pass because an integer variable would overflow in some testcases. So I have to change to another method to solve the problem and I made it!

### R1D9
Today is R1D9. I wrote a few python class for an academic project. I havent' used python for a long time but I now could quickly adapt to it. The classes are used to complete some data manipulation.

### R1D10
TOday is R1D10. I completed the python module for processing the financial data, which involed of the pandas and pymsql library. 

### R1D11
TOday is R1D11. I started to learn and set up the environment of Spring+SpringMVC+MyBatis. I am going to set up a website with my friend. 

### R1D12 
Completed the problem of second chapter of the algorithm of Princeton. Also started to design the update module for the DTD index auto updating system.

### R1D13
Oct,22. Completed the updating module of the financial table for the indexing system. I found that it is quite useful for us to review the code we wrote before and try to improve them. 

### R1D14
Oct,23. Completed two algorithm problems on leetcode. One is about doubly linked listï¼Œwhich cost me some time to solve some bugs...Anyway, happy coding everyday!

### R1D15
Oct,28. Actually I forgot to update the file because I was too busy for the last few days. I completed the auto check-update module of the DTD system, it would check if the update is complete. And I also completed a few problems on leetcode.
